# <a name="pointers-c"></a>Pointers (C++)

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object. Pointers are used extensively in both C and C++ for three main purposes:

- to allocate new objects on the heap,
- to pass functions to other functions
- to iterate over elements in arrays or other data structures.

In C-style programming, *raw pointers* are used for all these scenarios. However, raw pointers are the source of many serious programming errors. Therefore, their use is strongly discouraged except where they provide a significant performance benefit and there is no ambiguity as to which pointer is the *owning pointer* that is responsible for deleting the object. Modern C++ provides *smart pointers* for allocating objects, *iterators* for traversing data structures, and *lambda expressions* for passing functions. By using these language and library facilities instead of raw pointers, you will make your program safer, easier to debug, and simpler to understand and maintain. See [Smart pointers](smart-pointers-modern-cpp.md), [Iterators](../standard-library/iterators.md), and [Lambda expressions](lambda-expressions-in-cpp.md) for more information.
